We take pride in our great homemade food and friendly service and with a great selection of 15 beers on tap and 35 others in bottles, we like our neighbourhood pub to make you feel at home. Since the beginning we have won many local awards. For 2018/2019 the people of Squamish, through the local newspaper voted us the best Pub and the restaurant with best appetizers and wings. More awards than any other restaurant/pub.</p>
